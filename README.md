# Kahia.Web.VirtualPathProvider
This package enables serving all type of files from assemblies (dlls) just like you are exploring using file explorer; even you can serve aspx, master, ascx files, whatever you wish. For example, if you enable Directory Browsing from IIS for these virtual paths, everyting would work fine.
